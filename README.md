## Overview

[WP Kit](http://wpkit.io) is a WordPress Starter Kit built in top of Google's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit). If you are not familier with WSK, we highly recommend that you checkout their GitHub repository and explore the build itself. All tools from WSK has been imported over and we have further tailored WP Kit to play nicely when building WordPress themes during development. The end goal of WP Kit is to build WordPress sites faster, simpler and better.

We kept the Web Starter Kit features list here for reference on what WP Kit can do.

We'll update the README file periodically, as we're still creating the WP Kit guide.
